# Sign-up-page
I created a volunteer sign-up page using HTML and internal CSS. The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, phone number and date of birth. The design is clean and user-friendly, with a responsive layout to ensure accessibility on various devices. Simple styling enhances the overall aesthetics.
